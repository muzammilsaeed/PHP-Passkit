# PHP Passkit classes
This repository contains a few PHP classes that make it easy to create, edit and manage Passes (.pkpass) for iOS 6 Passbook.

Please note that iOS 6 and Passbook are still in beta, which means that the API can change at any moment. As new beta releases of iOS 6 come up, I'll try to update the class as soon as possible and add more features.

## Usage
Please take a look at the `readme.md` file in the folder of a specific class.
